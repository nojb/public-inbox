# Consider looking at public-inbox-netd@.service instead of this file
# to simplify management when serving multiple protocols.
#
# Since SIGUSR2 upgrades do not work under systemd, this service file
# allows starting two simultaneous services during upgrade time
# (e.g. public-inbox-imapd@1 public-inbox-imapd@2) with the intention
# that they take turns running in-between upgrades.  This should
# allow upgrading without downtime.
